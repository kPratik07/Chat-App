# Gemini Frontend

A modern, responsive, and feature-rich frontend application  that simulates a Gemini-style conversational AI chat experience. This project showcases my skills in UI/UX design, component-based architecture, state management, and modern client-side development using React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to build a polished, production-ready frontend with:

- OTP-based authentication
- Chatroom and message management
- AI-like responses
- Image handling
- Responsive UI and accessibility

All features are simulated and handled purely on the client side using modern frontend tools.
